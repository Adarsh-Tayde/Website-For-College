Department of Chemical Engineering
The department was established in 1994, offers graduate, postgraduate (M.Tech), and doctoral (Ph.D) courses in chemical engineering. There is a great demand of chemical engineers in a wide spectrum of industries like petroleum refineries, basic chemicals, fertilizers, soaps and detergents, cements, pharmaceuticals etc. Of late, chemical engineers are making rapid strides and playing key roles in various emerging fields of science and technology, nuclear engineering, biomedical engineering, etc.
The department provides basic knowledge of chemical engineering in addition to the technological understanding. The department also provides best supporting infrastructure for assimilation of new developments in the field. Latest equipments are made available in the laboratories to visualize the phenomenon under study and to Consolidate fundamentals of the subject. The department provide necessary professional training to the budding technocrafts by arranging lectures of the eminent personalities from the academic institutes of repute and industries. The department has well equipped laboratories namely chemical Engineering Operations, Industrial Waste Water Treatment, Membrane Separation Laboratory, Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, Chemical Reaction Engineering, Process Dynamic and Control, Chemical Engineering and Analytical Laboratory.
Testing facilities like Chemical analysis using Gas Chromatography and Water Quality Analysis are available in the department. The students of the final year of Chemical Engineering work on various latest and relevant topics like production of bio-diesel, application of membrane separation technology, crystallization and simulation studies of distillation column etc. The students also prepare the working model to represent their projects. The department actively promotes industry-institute interaction by offering consultancy services to the industries in the surrounding areas. Alumni of the department are well placed in reputed organization / industries in India and abroad and some of them are pursuing higher educational abroad.
Chemical Engineering Student Association (ChESA) provides platform for exchange of knowledge and information through interaction and organizes a National level Technical Paper Presentation every year.
